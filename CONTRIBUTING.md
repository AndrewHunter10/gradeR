## How to contribute to `gradeR`

### **Big picture stuff**

I am looking for help in additions that will allow more instructors and professors to take advantage of this software. Right now, the barriers to entry are that 

* Gradescope autograders for each assignment require too much manual labor,

* writing test files can be automated more, and

* there could be more examples. 

Ideally, an instructor would be able to use this package without writing any code in `R` or `shell`. Here's more information on how you could help. 

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* We have plenty of issues labeled as "good first issue" that can be easily fixed by contributors of all skill levels. If you're interested in learning more about any issue, feel free to contribute to the discussion via comments. 

* Suggest a new enhancement by opening up an [issue](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR/issues), and labeling it as an "enhanement."

* After you've written the code that provides the feature, open a new GitHub pull request with the enhancement.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code or how to incorporate `gradeR` into your own class?**

* Ask any question you have by opening up an [issue](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR/issues), and labeling it as a "question."

#### **Contribute a fully-worked example!**

* send us a link to a Github repository with a self-contained example, and I will be sure to link to it in this project's README!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/tbrown122387/gradeR/issues/new) and label it as a "bug." 

* Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you fix a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of `gradeR` will generally not be accepted.



Thanks!

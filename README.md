Installation
------------

<!-- You can install the released version of gradeR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("gradeR") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("tbrown122387/gradeR") -->
<!-- ``` -->
You can install the development version of `gradeR` from with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tbrown122387/gradeR")
```

Example
-------

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

#library(gradeR)
#setwd("~/gradeR/example/")
#grades <- gradeR("/path/to/assignment1_submissions/", "/path/to/grade_hw1.R")
```
